#Introduction:
The purpose of this website is to allow virtually anyone involved with MLS to see how players did during the 2022 season, whether you are a diehard fan, executive, or just a casual stats lover. It also allows people to compare players to each other, as it can spark more league-wide conversation and debates about who the best players are and how they are performing.

#Design:
Almost every MLS player statistic from the 2022 season is in this database. All stats are from the MLS and Wyscout, a platform used to get player/team statistics on almost every league in the world. 

#Future work:
In the future, I would like to incorporate more filters to see who are the top players in each position.
